I tried to explore one of the products in the arrays of Google Development product: Google Maps Platform.
Unfortunately, I don't have credit cards to set up the billing account.
So, I only read the "Getting Started with GPM" page and try to understand what it offers.
I also read "Create a simple store locator with Google Maps Platform", which employs GeoJSON data.
It's so relatable to me because I've once made a similar maps using an entirely different platform (ArcGIS).
ArcGIS is based on Phyton, so I think by learning more about GPM, I could also improve my knowledge on ArcGIS and other mapping platform,
eventhough GPM uses different language.
